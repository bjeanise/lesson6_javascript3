### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:

1. *JavaScript programs affect documents that browsers display through a data structure called the document object model (DOM) and can modify the DOM to change the visible document.* In the photo gallery application, JavaScript programming code modifying the DOM made the following user interaction possible: Users clicking on the _>button_ on the right side of the screen resulting in all images shifting to the left.  Users clicking on the _< button_ on the left side of the screen allowing scrolling through the photos in the gallery.  Users clicking the *"Show more images"* button adding two more images into the gallery.

2. *The importance of examples and instructional guidance in learning JavaScript programming.* The step-by-step instructions were instrumental in my understanding of the application's logic and code.  

3. *The importance of practice.* In lesson 6, the W3schools website, the online interactive book Eloquent JavaScript, 3rd Edition, and Interactive Js lessons provided interactive exercises that facilitated my learning JavaScript programming theory and enabled my understanding of the code and instructions in the Photo Gallery Application assignment.
